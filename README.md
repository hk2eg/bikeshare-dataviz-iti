# Capital Bikeshare Data Visualization

## Overview

This repository contains the final project for the **Data Visualization** course at ITI, part of a 4-month Data Engineering internship. It presents an interactive dashboard in Power BI to analyze 2011–2012 Capital Bikeshare usage, from monthly trends down to hourly profiles, with a focus on the impact of weather and key events.  

Special thanks to **Dr. Eman Raslan** for her attentive guidance throughout the course.

## Data Modeling

We implemented a **constellation (galaxy) schema**:

- **Dimensions**  
  - `dim_date` (date_key, date, year, month, day, weekday, is_holiday, is_working)  
  - `dim_time` (hour_of_day, time_label)  
  - `dim_season` (season_id, season_name)  
  - `dim_weather` (weather_id, weather_desc)

- **Fact Tables**  
  - `fact_daily_rentals` (daily totals and weather averages)  
  - `fact_hourly_rentals` (hourly counts and metrics)

---

## Key Steps

1. **Exploration & Quality**  
   - Data completeness, consistency, and validity checks  

2. **Denormalization**  
   - Converted normalized temp, atemp, hum, windspeed to °C, °C, %, mph

3. **Schema Build**  
   - Created conformed dimensions and two facts in notebooks  
   - Exported tables as CSV for easy Power BI import

4. **Dashboard Design**  
   - Configured Power BI relationships and data types  
   - Developed DAX measures for totals, growth rates, and averages  
   - Designed slicers for Year, Month, Weather, Season  
   - Crafted visuals: KPI cards, line, combo, bar, and donut charts.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hk2eg/bikeshare-dataviz-iti.git
   ```
2. **Fill in Data**:
   - Place raw CSVs from `data/` in the same folder  
   - Ensure `csv/` output files are generated by running the notebooks

3. **Open Power BI**:
   - Load `powerbi/Bike-Sharing-Dashboard.pbix`  
   - Refresh data sources if needed

4. **Explore**:
   - Use slicers to filter by Year/Month/Weather/Season  
   - Analyze monthly trends and daily/hourly patterns
